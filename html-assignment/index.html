    <p>Hello, my name is Angel, Am a Nigerian and a level one Interactive media design student. I love doing so many things but I have hoobies and there; </p>
    <ul>
     <li>Drawing</li> 
     <li>dancing</li> 
     <li>cooking</li> 
     <li>singing</li> 
     <li>Traveling</li> 
    </ul>
     <p>In Nigeria I studied more of science subejects because I thought I would end with a medical career but while growing I found out that I have more interest in arts courses. So I started going to a computer school which I did not complete because of some issues in my country but before i left I learnt alot of things and am happy I did.</p>
